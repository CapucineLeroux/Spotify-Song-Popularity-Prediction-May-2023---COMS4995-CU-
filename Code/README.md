# Code base

The preprocessing and training specific to Regression Models (Linear, Regularized, Tree and Random Forest) are in the "Regression_Models.ipynb" file. 

The preprocessing and training specific to Neural Network Model is in the "Neural Network Model.ipynb" file.

The process to generate clean dataset is in the "data_cleaning.ipynb"

The process for exploratory data analysis is in the "Cleaning & Exploration.ipynb"

The preprocessing and training specific to Gradient Boosting and XGBoosting regressors (and classifiers) are in the  "gradient_regressors.ipynb" file. Within this file, is also linked screenshots of some results that I got from my training but couldn't replicate in this file. These screenshots are in the "gradient_screenshots" folder. Currently, they are not being read correctly as GitHub doesn't correctly render images via "img src=path"

The preprocessing and training specific to baseline and SMOTE-oversampling Random Forest Classifiction are in the "Random_Forest_Oversampling.ipynb" file. There are also screenshots depicting the distributions of the popularity tracks column (target) along with accompanying images depicting the distributions after thresholding, undersampling, and SMOTE.
